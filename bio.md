My name is Chris Trana.  I live in Boise, ID and work as an underwriter for an insurance company.
My wife, Julie, and I have 2 dogs, Addie and Tucker, and 1 cat, Nigel.
I enjoy reading, playing games (cards, board games, video games), watching movies, watching sports,
walking the dogs and spending time with my wife.
I'm taking this CS program from OSU in order to move into an analyst type role in the insurance industry.
However, I'm keeping my options open and wouldn't rule out switching fields and careers entirely.
My wife and I are planning on travelling when things settle down and we have some time.  Our first trip will
be somewhere tropical.  Possibly Hawaii or somewhere in South America like Belize.

Programming Background
Prior to staring this program at OSU I had no programming experience.
So far I've had exposure to C++ (CS 161, 162), C (CS 261), and MASM (271).
My favorite project so far was the simple fighting game we made in CS 161.
I did enjoy assambley language and may look into getting more experience there when time permits.
