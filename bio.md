My name is Chris Trana.  I live in Boise, ID with my wife, Julie. 
I work as an underwriter for an insurance company which specializes in insuring truckers.
We have 2 dogs, Addie and Tucker, and 1 cat, Nigel.  Since we don't have any children the pets get prety spoiled.
I enjoy reading, playing games (cards, board games, video games), watching movies, watching sports,
walking the dogs and spending time with my wife.
My wife and I are planning on travelling when things settle down and we have some time.  Our first trip will
be somewhere tropical.  Possibly Hawaii or somewhere in South America like Belize.
I would like to take up race car driving as well.  Not like Nascar or drag racing, but with modified sports cars
like you see on the show Top Gear.

Programming Background
Prior to staring this program at OSU I had no programming experience.
So far I've had exposure to C++ (CS 161, 162), C (CS 261), and MASM (271).
My favorite project so far was the simple fighting game we made in CS 161.
I did enjoy assambley language and may look into getting more experience there when time permits.
