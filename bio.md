My name is Chris Trana.  I live in Boise, ID and work as an underwriter for an insurance company.
My wife, Julie, and I have 2 dogs, Addie and Tucker, and 1 cat, Nigel.
I enjoy reading, playing games (cards, board games, video games), watching movies, watching sports,
walking the dogs and spending time with my wife.
My wife and I are planning on travelling when things settle down and we have some time.  Our first trip will
be somewhere tropical.  Possibly Hawaii or somewhere in South America like Belize.
