I enjoy reading, playing games (cards, board games, video games), watching movies, and watching sports.
My wife and I are planning on traveling when things settle down and we have some time.  Our first trip will
be somewhere tropical.  Possibly Hawaii or somewhere in South America like Belize.

Programming Background
Prior to staring this program at OSU I had no programming experience.
So far I've had exposure to C++ (CS 161, 162), C (CS 261), and MASM (271).
My favorite project so far was the simple fighting game we made in CS 161.
I did enjoy assambley language and may look into getting more experience there when time permits.
